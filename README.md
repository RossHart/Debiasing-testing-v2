In the 'Notebooks' repo, only really the debiasing.ipynb is relevant. 
You'll need to download that as a .py file and put it in the 'Codes' if you want to run it. 
There's also a .sh file to run all of the questions in order.
Functions and stuff can be added to the 'make_dictionaries.py' code. I've tried to put all of the questions
and stuff into dictionary format (so that they know which questions came before etc.).
